# License_Plate_detection_and_toll_collection
License_Plate_detection_and_toll_collection is a Python-based computer vision project that automatically detects vehicle license plates from real-time images or video streams and extracts the plate number using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It simulates an automated toll collection system by identifying registered vehicles.

## Version 1.0: License Plate Text Extraction with GUI
Version 1 introduces a simple **Python-based GUI application** for extracting text from license plates using `EasyOCR` and `OpenCV`. It processes images offline and displays the results in a Tkinter interface.

### Added: extract_img.py
- A utility script that extracts text from a given license plate image.  
- Uses EasyOCR to detect text and visualize results with OpenCV and Matplotlib.  
- Part of the core functionality for testing OCR separately from the GUI.
#### Requirements 
``` bash
 pip install opencv-python pytesseract pygame numpy easyocr matplotlib numpy pillow
```

## Version 1.1: License Plate Text Extraction with GUI
This version is made with the intention of gamifying the experience. This is just a random alpha phase for the project where we test out all the grounds on making the user experience better in the view of user requirements.

## Version 1.3: Manual approach of data entry
Option to enter the license plate manually by entering it with an input device is added and also added an option to edit the vehicle number if there are any small descrepencies with the text or number scanned.

## Version 1.4: Increased fields and implemented search
This version focused on increasing the column values and best way to filter the data using in-built search. The data will be stored in cache for the current version with future plans to extend the capability to store locally or using Database.

## Version 1.5: Using a WebApp interface 
We decided to shift the focus from Desktop Gui to Webapp, this is more flexible and accessible across all the platforms and devices of various dimensions. THe plan is to integrate the local save of data.
